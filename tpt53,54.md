- Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)
- Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
> - Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?<br>
  _The owner of the computer does not think that this was intentional._
> - If yes or no, justify you conclusion. <br>
  _The owner of the computer does not think taht this was intentional because he doesn't seem to be mad, and claimed that HP is racist in a joking manner._
> - How do you think this happened? <br>
_This happened probably because the camera/computer was unable to distinguish the man with the surrounding and assumed that he is part of the background_
> - Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? <br>
_This was not intended to be harmful. However, it could be considered harmful because the man purchased the product that does not work as intended._
> - Should it be corrected? <br>
_This should be corrected as the product does not perform its job correctly._
> - What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?<br>
_I would first test the function under different conditions to confirm that it actually works._



### 5.4 Notes -- Crowdsourcing

- Crowdsourcing
- Essential knowledge
> - Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
> - Science has been affected by using distributed and citizen science to solve scientific problems
> - Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientist, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices


- Public Data Sets
> - Kaggle
> - Courses in visualizations, machine learning, and more
> - Competitions - cash prizes, swag, props
> - Notebooks
> - Google public datasets
> - Free for the 1st terabyte
> - All-in-one package that uses BigQuery
> - Data.gov
> - US Government data
> - Agriculture, energy, water, health
> - Local government
- Distributed Computing
> - Donate spare computing power to help calculations
> - Science has been affected by using distributed and citizen science to solve scientific problems
> - Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom many not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
> - Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
- Innovations made possible with crowdsourcing
> - Spotify

> - CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?<br>
_A crowdsource idea that we can conduct in CompSci is a website that allows students to post questions that they have about coding, and other students can give inputs in heping to solve the issue. This is a crowdsource data because it relies on the public to give input to the website._
> - What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?<br>
> _Del Norte crowdsourcing could gather student's opinions and expereinces with the classes that they have taken at Del Norte. Our final project can be better wil crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing may allow our project to include more books that we may previously not included on our website._
