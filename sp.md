  The answer is not D. The upgraded system selects the appropriate department based on the customerâ€™s issue, so the customer does not have the ability to make an incorrect selection. The correct answer is B. The company is not able to provide a human representative for calls made after business hours.

  The answer is not D. The ability to use multiple protocols is not affected by how packets are routed. Choice B is correct. Routers on the Internet are able to move packets through various paths to reach their final destination, even when some connections have failed. This characterizes the fault-tolerant nature of routing.

  Choice A is not correct. Statement III is also correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

The minimum of two processors will be the sum of the two processors that takes the least amount of time. Therefore, the answer will be 30 + 50, which is 80. Thus, the answer is C and not A.

B is incorrect. The efficiency of a parallel solution is limited by a sequential portion. Eventually, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency. Choice D is the correct answer. Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.

C is incorrect. The application must download books and articles from the Internet, so it is unlikely that users with limited Internet access will have an improved ability to obtain books and articles. D is correct. Users with visual impairments can set their personal preferences to make text easier for them to read. These users can also enable text-to-speech to allow them to listen to text.

B is incorrect. The application only sends notifications to compatible users who are nearby. Since not all people will be considered compatible, users are unlikely to be able to identify all other users in the area. C is correct. The application can be used to connect users with other nearby users, which may encourage users to exercise together. This may have the effect of improving user health.

Option A is incorrect. The average total points earned per student can also be determined using the result of the total points calculation for each student. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can also be determined by calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. Therefore, D is correct.

The answer is not C.  While it is possible to disconnect computers U and T by removing three connections, it can be done by removing only two connections. The answer is B. If the connections between U and V and between U and P were removed, then computer T and computer U can no longer communicate.

A is incorrect. While some solutions benefit from being validated by a human, not all problems can be solved with an algorithm. D is correct. An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. Some instances of an undecidable problem may have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.

Answer C is incorrect. This algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19. The number 20 is not displayed since the algorithm terminates immediately after x is assigned the value 20. Answer D is correct. This algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20. After 20 is displayed, x is incremented to 21. The value 21 is not displayed since it is a multiple of 3 and the algorithm terminates.

C is incorrect. The procedure does not return the value of n * n. For a procedure to return n * n, it could initialize result to 0 and then repeatedly add n to result a total of n times. D is correct. The procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.

Answer A is incorrect. The procedure will display 2, which is the correct index for the targetName "Ben". Answer C is correct. The procedure will not display the correct value of foundIndex if the targetName is "Ben". In the FOR EACH loop, when the value of name is "Andrea", the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 0. When the value of name is "Ben", the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 1. But as the loop continues, and the value of name is "Chris", the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 0. The procedure displays 0, even though the correct answer is 1.

A is not correct. Overwhelming a system with requests in order to deny service can be done regardless of password strength. D is correct. A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. Weak passwords can often be guessed based on publicly available information about a user. Other weak passwords (such as "password" or "1234") can often be guessed because they are commonly used.

A is incorrect. While the number of registered users appears to have grown at a constant rate for years 5 to 8, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year for years 1 to 5. C is correct. From years 1 to 5, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year. From years 5 to 8, the number of registered users increased by about 100 million each year.

B is incorrect. The Internet is a network of interconnected networks, but the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet. D is correct. The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses protocols to connect devices worldwide. The World Wide Web is an information system (of pages, programs, and files) that is accessible over the Internet.

B is correct. As this algorithm has a factorial efficiency, it does not run in a reasonable amount of time. A heuristic approach can be used to find an approximate solution than can run in a reasonable amount of time. C is incorrect. This algorithm has linear efficiency, so it runs in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, a heuristic is not appropriate.

C is incorrect. Inserting Win, left arrow, true between line 20 and line 21 will cause the loop to terminate when the guess is incorrect. B is correct. Inserting Win, left arrow, true between line 9 and line 10 will cause the loop to terminate when the guess is correct.

D is correct. This code segment sets bonus to 0 when score < 50, sets bonus to score * 10 when score > 100, and sets bonus to score when 100 â‰¥ score â‰¥ 50.
