  The answer is not D. The ability to use multiple protocols is not affected by how packets are routed. Choice B is correct. Routers on the Internet are able to move packets through various paths to reach their final destination, even when some connections have failed. This characterizes the fault-tolerant nature of routing.

  Choice A is not correct. Statement III is also correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

The minimum of two processors will be the sum of the two processors that takes the least amount of time. Therefore, the answer will be 30 + 50, which is 80. Thus, the answer is C and not A.

B is incorrect. The efficiency of a parallel solution is limited by a sequential portion. Eventually, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency. Choice D is the correct answer. Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.

C is incorrect. The application must download books and articles from the Internet, so it is unlikely that users with limited Internet access will have an improved ability to obtain books and articles. D is correct. Users with visual impairments can set their personal preferences to make text easier for them to read. These users can also enable text-to-speech to allow them to listen to text.

B is incorrect. The application only sends notifications to compatible users who are nearby. Since not all people will be considered compatible, users are unlikely to be able to identify all other users in the area. C is correct. The application can be used to connect users with other nearby users, which may encourage users to exercise together. This may have the effect of improving user health.

Option A is incorrect. The average total points earned per student can also be determined using the result of the total points calculation for each student. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can also be determined by calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. Therefore, D is correct.
