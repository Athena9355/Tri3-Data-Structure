### TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

> | Beneficial Effects | Harmful Effects |
> | --- | --- |
> | Computing allows big data to be collected form users and provide customized ads that corresponds with the user's interest | Privacy concerns may rise as users are uncomfortable that their text messages are being reviewed and recorded |
> | Computing allows models to be easily built. This is beneficial since certain experiments will be hard / impossible to conduct in real-life. | The models built may have bias and assumptions that does not apply to the real world. Overly relying on the result of the simulation may result in wrong predictions, which may then cause the wrong actions to be taken. |
> | Computing allows complicated programs to be developed, creating games and other forms of entertainment. | Games and other forms of entertainment using computers may be addicting, causing people to be unable to concentrate on their work. Furthermore, they are also harmful to human health (may result in issues in eyes etc.) |

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
> I believe that the dopamine issue is real. I believe that video games are addictive and may especially affect a student's performance at school. For me, reasonable gaming and social media allows me to relax and take a break from school work. Thus, I think the dopamine issue is beneficial to me.


### TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
> Use the technology to learn or contribute to the society. Furthermore, one could also use the resources online to achieve his or her own goals (e.g. Someone who wants to be a celebrity but does not have the chance could use Youtube as a platform to achieve their goal).


2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
> Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by sharing what they had learned with those who are not empowered.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
> Red tape blocks digital empowerment, and there are such barriers at Del Norte. For example, the students are unable to have unlimited access to the school wifi. The school wifi does not allow students to enter certain websites. Another example is that, using a school chrome book, the student is unable to log in to other google accounts other than the school account.
