# Idea
### For the idea for the sponsored project, we chose to come up create a book website that keeps track of students progress in their reading and creates quizzes and assess their understanding of the material.
# Project and Technical Plan
### For this project, there needs to be login credentials that are created for the teacher when making the quiz. The quiz itself would have CRUD feature since the teacher needs to be able to edit, delete, and create new questions. Additionally, there need to be classcodes implemented so only students can take the quizes. A timer on the quiz might be a stretch goal but would greatly improve the usability of the website.
# Basic Layout
